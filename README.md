# Dog-Breed-Classifier
## Project Description 
Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep neural networks don't have all the answers. However, maybe they can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of good pup is that?

In this project, I build and define a neural network from scratch and use ResNet 50 to classify/identify dog breeds, How well you can tell your Norfolk Terriers from your Norwich Terriers? With 120 breeds of dogs and a limited number training images per class, we might find the problem more, err, ruff than we all anticipated.

Still I achieved an ** Accuracy of 93% with ResNet 50** and 16% with CNN model built from scratch.
